This is my final project for cs50 course.
This is ad website. It has some info about company, and can send instant e-mail messages through flask-mail.
The base html and css is free and was taken from https://templatemo.com/.
This site uses bootstraps css and js.
While preparing this project I have lerned how to use virtual environment.
The site was deployed on heroku with gunicorn and fully functional.
